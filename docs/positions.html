                <h2>Software Developer</h2>
                <p>Software developers (or computer programmers) are the brains behind the design, installation, testing and maintenance of software systems.</p>
                <p>Developers are now making software do things that have never been done before, leaving their fingerprints all over our lives. </p>
                <p>From the alarm clock on your smartphone waking you up in the morning to the game you play right before bedtime, 
                    it is all created thanks to software developers. For most programmers, feeling like having the power to build anything and seeing their creations work is indeed the most rewarding part of their profession.</p>
                <p>As a software developer you'd be mostly responsible for: <br>Reviewing current systems, presenting ideas for system improvements including cost proposals, working closely with analysts/designers and staff, 
                    producing detailed specifications and writing the programme codes, testing the product in controlled situations before going live, preparation of training manuals for users, maintaining the systems once they are up and running.</p>
                <p>As a graduate you'll probably start on around £20,000 to £25,000. Once you reach a management level your salary will increase to £26,000 to £70,000, or even higher with bonuses.</p>
                <p>To learn more about the role visit the following link <a href="https://www.totaljobs.com/careers-advice/job-profile/it-jobs/software-developer-job-description">here.</a></p>

                <h2>Web Developer</h2>
                <p>Web developers are a unique breed, and the development projects they work on have a number of key differences. For instance, web developers develop their products on a web server and use a web browser as a graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
                <p>Consequently, web developers also need to think about cross-browser compatibility, i.e. how the web application will function across various different browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera and Safari.</p>
                <p>How this role differs slightly to a software developer is web development can be split into two main disciplines: front-end development and back-end development.</p>
                <p>Web developers can use a plethora of different scripting languages to create web applications, such as PHP, Javascript, HTML, Python to achieve their design.</p>
                <p>Quite like entry level software developers, entry-level web developers tend to earn between £20,000 and £27,000 per annum. Senior web developers, however, can earn up to £70,000 a year, and freelance contractors can earn considerably more.</p>

                <h2>Games Developer</h2>
                <p>Games developers use their creative flair and technical prowess to create the video games that keep us glued to the screen for hours, days and sometimes weeks at a time. </p>
                <p>Without these guys there would be no Halo, there would be no Angry Birds, and there would be no Singstar (ok, maybe we could live without that last one; especially the way my significant other sings!).</p>
                <p>Developers tend to specialise in one or two areas of the incredibly complex games development process, such as design, programming, testing or 3D modelling.</p>
                <p>Many games developers focus their efforts on coding, using programming languages, such as C++, and scripting languages, such as Python and Lua.</p>
                <p>Games developers are debatably most like software developers; in the sense that they test and programme the vast amount of code for their products. On the other hand sharing similar programming languages with web developers does share that similarity.</p>
                <p>The salary for games developers is also just as competitive, with entry-level games developers tending to earn between £18,000 and £26,000 per annum. With Senior games developers, however, earning up to £75,000 a year which is seemingly higher that the previous two specialistions.</p>
