                    <h3>Apple</h3>
                    <p3>Apple has always been a key innovator when it comes to technology, so having a responsive website would be imperitive to their success.</p3>
                    <p3>Having analysed their site by looking at how they layout their pages and their navigation; for my site I have taken inspiration from their large use of pictures to direct the user through the page.</p3>
                    <p3>Large displays of products and colours helps to keep users engaged and is a clever way to split the website page up.</p3>
                    <p3>How I have managed to implement this into my page is to introduce each page with a large splash image which is full of colour or relevant to the page.</p3>
                    <p3>By having pictures throughout the page as well; this was used as another method to help with the layout of the site.</p3> 
                    <p3>Take a look at Apple's UK site for further examples and techniques, please visit <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/">here.</a></p3>

                    <h3>D3R</h3>
                    <p3>The D3R group drew my attention specifically towards the use of colours on their page and the imagery they had used as another form of navigation around their site.</p3>
                    <p3>I particularly liked the consistancy throughout their site and the use of the turqouise brand colour accompanying other complimantary colours.</p3>
                    <p3>Having taken this on board for my site, I had decided on using my own complemantary colours to use through the site. The two prominant colours being Orange and blue with the use of different shades of those colours and light greys to soften the page.</p3>
                    <p3>I also liked D3R's layout on their staff page. I also adopted this and added coloured hexagonal shapes to keep in with the theme of the index page.</p3>

                    <h3>Zurb</h3>
                    <p3>Zurb's site was, in my opinion, a beautifully crafted design in web development.</p3>
                    <p3>The site was seemless, clean and had splashes of colour which were striking and eye-catching. Something I wanted to replicate within my own site.</p3>
                    <p3>By using the colours and design I had chosen, I felt that I had achieved this.</p3>
                    <p3>Furthermore, I particularly liked how their images would be used to soften hard lines through the page by placing imagery over the top to create the seemless look.</p3>
                    <p3>Something i wanted to replicate through my own site by placing the logo I designed overlapping text fields on the page.</p3>
